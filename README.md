# Movie-Recommendation-System

Project Description: Developed a user-based movie recommendation system using Python and pandas. The system calculates the maximum correlation of one user with the rest of the users in the dataset. 
Additionally, it compares the viewing history of two users to determine the correlation between them, which is used to suggest personalized movie recommendations to each user.
